# vue-car-booking [ ![Codeship Status for mscharl/vue-car-booking](https://app.codeship.com/projects/a83b1830-9071-0135-51f1-72b5e3f907b6/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/250206)

I am a participant in an car-sharing-project offered by my municipality. The software that is
used to book the car is good and working. But as far as I found out, it is
technically outdated and it feels a bit slow.

I want to rebuild the software and make it feel fast.

## Build Setup

I'm using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) under the hood and setup the project
based on an vue-cli template. 

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn run dev

# build for production with minification
yarn run build
```
